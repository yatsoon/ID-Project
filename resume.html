      <h2>Some of my Personal work:</h2>
      <h3>Application logo design</h3>
      <p>Application logo redesign that i did for my module's assessment. The objective of the assesment was to re-design the application logo. Hence, i re-designed the logo by adding in more elements into the logo as the old logo was plain and was unable to allow its users to know about the applications features. This project enabled me to learn how to use the adobe illustrator software to create and to design a logo.</p>
